Assigning texts to pre-defined classes is called text classification.Text classification includes spam-filtering and context-awareness. Text classification can also be used to classify emergency situations in panic conversations. This task can be automated using machine learning. This seminar aims to compare the effectiveness of Neural Networks (NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) in text classification. In this seminar, the procedures of NN and SVM will be described and applied to text classification. Then, the performances of both methods are compared. Lastly, this seminar will recommend the use of one of the methods over the other.
